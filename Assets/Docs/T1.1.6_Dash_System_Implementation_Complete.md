# T1.1.6: Dash System Foundation - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the enhanced dash system for Mech Salvager's PlayerController with energy management, directional movement, and resource constraints.

## Implementation Summary

### Energy System Added
- **Max Energy**: 100f (configurable in Inspector)
- **Current Energy**: Starts at 100f, regenerates over time
- **Dash Energy Cost**: 25f per dash (configurable)
- **Energy Regeneration**: 20f per second (configurable)

### Enhanced Dash Mechanics
- **Dash Force**: 15f (configurable in Inspector)
- **Dash Cooldown**: 0.5f seconds (configurable)
- **Direction Logic**: Uses current input or remembers last movement direction
- **Works in Air**: Dash functions both grounded and airborne
- **Energy Validation**: Prevents spam-dashing through energy consumption

### Code Changes Made

#### New Header Sections
```csharp
[Header("Energy System")]
[SerializeField] private float maxEnergy = 100f;
[SerializeField] private float currentEnergy = 100f;
[SerializeField] private float dashEnergyCost = 25f;
[SerializeField] private float energyRegenRate = 20f; // energy per second

[Header("Dash System")]
[SerializeField] private float dashForce = 15f;
[SerializeField] private float dashCooldown = 0.5f;
```

#### New Private Variables
```csharp
private float dashCooldownTimer = 0f;
private Vector2 lastMoveDirection = Vector2.right; // default dash direction
```

#### Energy Management Methods
```csharp
private bool CanDash()
{
    return currentEnergy >= dashEnergyCost && dashCooldownTimer <= 0f;
}

private void ConsumeEnergy(float amount)
{
    currentEnergy = Mathf.Max(0f, currentEnergy - amount);
}

private void RegenerateEnergy()
{
    if (currentEnergy < maxEnergy)
    {
        currentEnergy = Mathf.Min(maxEnergy, currentEnergy + energyRegenRate * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced Update Loop
- Tracks last movement direction for dash
- Regenerates energy over time
- Updates dash cooldown timer
- Maintains compatibility with existing systems

#### Improved HandleDash Method
- Uses energy system validation
- Improved direction handling (current input or last direction)
- Works in air and on ground
- Enhanced debug logging with energy information
- Detailed failure logging (insufficient energy, cooldown active)

#### Public API Enhancements
```csharp
public bool CanDashState => CanDash();
public float CurrentEnergy => currentEnergy;
public float MaxEnergy => maxEnergy;
public float EnergyPercent => currentEnergy / maxEnergy;
public float DashCooldownRemaining => dashCooldownTimer;
```

#### Visual Debug Enhancements
- Scene view energy display: `Energy: {current}/{max}`
- Scene view cooldown display: `Dash CD: {time}s`
- Enhanced console logging with energy state
- State logging includes energy and cooldown information

## Requirements Validation ✅

### ✅ Energy System with Current/Max Values and Consumption
- Energy starts at 100/100
- Each dash consumes 25 energy
- Energy regenerates at 20 per second
- All values configurable in Inspector

### ✅ Dash Applies Directional Force Based on Last Movement Input
- Uses current horizontal input if available
- Falls back to last movement direction if no current input
- Default direction is right (Vector2.right)

### ✅ Energy Cost Prevents Spam-Dashing
- Dash requires 25 energy minimum
- With 100 max energy, allows 4 consecutive dashes
- Must wait for regeneration before additional dashes

### ✅ Energy Regeneration Over Time
- Regenerates at 20 energy per second
- Takes 5 seconds to fully regenerate from empty
- 1.25 seconds to regenerate enough for one dash

### ✅ Cooldown System to Prevent Rapid Successive Dashes
- 0.5 second cooldown between dashes
- Separate from energy system for dual protection
- Prevents dash spamming even with full energy

### ✅ Dash Works in Air and on Ground
- No ground check restriction in HandleDash
- Maintains horizontal velocity change regardless of grounded state
- Preserves vertical velocity (doesn't interrupt jumps/falls)

## Testing Recommendations

### Energy System Testing
1. **Full Energy Dashing**: Start with full energy, perform 4 dashes rapidly
2. **Energy Regeneration**: Wait and observe energy regeneration (should take 5 seconds from empty)
3. **Insufficient Energy**: Try dashing when energy is below 25

### Direction Testing
1. **Current Input Direction**: Move right/left and dash while moving
2. **Last Direction Memory**: Stop moving, dash should use last direction
3. **Default Direction**: Start game, dash without moving (should go right)

### Cooldown Testing
1. **Rapid Dash Attempts**: Try spamming dash key (should respect 0.5s cooldown)
2. **Combined Limits**: Test when both energy and cooldown are active

### Air Dash Testing
1. **Jump and Dash**: Jump then dash mid-air
2. **Fall and Dash**: Walk off platform and dash while falling
3. **Dash Direction in Air**: Test left/right dashing while airborne

## Debug Information Available

### Console Logs
- Successful dash: Direction, energy remaining, cooldown time
- Failed dash: Reason (insufficient energy or cooldown active)
- Player state every 60 frames: Energy, cooldown, velocity

### Scene View Display
- Energy bar: `Energy: {current}/{max}`
- Cooldown timer: `Dash CD: {time}s`
- Ground detection ray (green/red)

### Inspector Values
All energy and dash parameters are tunable in real-time:
- Max Energy
- Dash Energy Cost  
- Energy Regeneration Rate
- Dash Force
- Dash Cooldown

## Integration Notes

### Backwards Compatibility
- Maintains existing `canDash` boolean for legacy compatibility
- Preserves existing public API where possible
- Enhanced functionality is additive

### Performance Considerations
- Energy regeneration calculated in Update() using Time.deltaTime
- Cooldown timer updated in Update() using Time.deltaTime
- Minimal performance impact from energy system

### Future Enhancements Ready
- Easy to add energy UI display using public energy properties
- Sound effects can trigger on dash using existing debug logs
- Visual effects can use `CanDashState` and cooldown information
- Energy pickup items can modify `currentEnergy` directly

## Next Steps
With T1.1.6 complete, the core movement mechanics are now fully implemented:
- ✅ T1.1.1: Input Setup
- ✅ T1.1.2: Player GameObject Setup  
- ✅ T1.1.3: Horizontal Movement
- ✅ T1.1.4: Ground Detection
- ✅ T1.1.5: Jump Mechanics
- ✅ T1.1.6: Dash System Foundation

Ready for movement parameter tuning, polish, and UI integration.
