---

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### Core Look-Ahead Features Implemented

#### 1. **Velocity-Based Direction Detection**
```csharp
// Calculate player velocity each frame
playerVelocity = (player.position - lastPlayerPosition) / Time.deltaTime;
lastPlayerPosition = player.position;
```
**Functionality:**
- Tracks player position changes to calculate real-time velocity
- Normalizes velocity vector to get clean movement direction
- Only activates when player velocity exceeds configurable threshold

#### 2. **Configurable Look-Ahead Parameters**
```csharp
[Header("Look-Ahead Settings")]
public bool useLookAhead = true;                    // Enable/disable system
[Range(0f, 5f)] public float lookAheadDistance = 2f; // How far ahead to look
[Range(1f, 10f)] public float lookAheadSpeed = 3f;   // Transition speed
[Range(0.1f, 2f)] public float velocityThreshold = 0.1f; // Minimum speed to activate
```

#### 3. **Smooth Directional Transitions**
```csharp
// Smoothly transition to target look-ahead
currentLookAhead = Vector3.Lerp(currentLookAhead, targetLookAhead, 
                               cameraConfig.lookAheadSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
```
**Behavior:**
- Gradual camera shift when player changes direction
- Smooth return to center when player stops moving
- Configurable transition speed for different camera feels

### Enhanced CameraConfigSO Integration
- **useLookAhead**: Boolean toggle to enable/disable predictive movement
- **lookAheadDistance**: Distance camera shifts ahead (0-5 units)
- **lookAheadSpeed**: How quickly camera transitions (1-10x speed)
- **velocityThreshold**: Minimum player speed to trigger look-ahead
- **showLookAheadGizmo**: Visual debugging toggle

## üìã Feature Integration

### Compatibility with Existing Systems
- **Deadzone Compatibility**: Look-ahead respects deadzone boundaries
- **Axis Constraints**: Only applies to enabled following axes (X/Y/Z)
- **Bounds System**: Look-ahead + bounds prevent camera going outside level
- **Smooth Following**: Works with both Lerp and SmoothDamp methods
- **Configuration Switching**: Look-ahead resets when changing configs

### Look-Ahead Calculation Logic
```csharp
private Vector3 CalculateLookAhead()
{
    if (!cameraConfig.useLookAhead || cameraConfig.lookAheadDistance <= 0f)
    {
        // Smoothly return to zero when disabled
        currentLookAhead = Vector3.Lerp(currentLookAhead, Vector3.zero, 
                                       cameraConfig.lookAheadSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        return currentLookAhead;
    }
    
    // Only apply look-ahead if player is moving fast enough
    Vector3 targetLookAhead = Vector3.zero;
    if (playerVelocity.magnitude > cameraConfig.velocityThreshold)
    {
        Vector3 lookDirection = playerVelocity.normalized;
        
        // Respect axis constraints for look-ahead
        if (!cameraConfig.followX) lookDirection.x = 0f;
        if (!cameraConfig.followY) lookDirection.y = 0f;
        if (!cameraConfig.followZ) lookDirection.z = 0f;
        
        targetLookAhead = lookDirection * cameraConfig.lookAheadDistance;
    }
    
    // Smooth transition
    currentLookAhead = Vector3.Lerp(currentLookAhead, targetLookAhead, 
                                   cameraConfig.lookAheadSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    return currentLookAhead;
}
```

## üé® Visual Debug Features

### Enhanced Scene View Gizmos
- **Magenta Line & Sphere**: Shows current look-ahead vector and target position
- **Yellow Line & Sphere**: Shows player velocity vector (scaled for visibility)
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when look-ahead is active and enabled
- **Real-time Updates**: Gizmos update as player moves and camera anticipates

### Look-Ahead Visualization
```csharp
// Look-ahead visualization
if (player != null && cameraConfig.showLookAheadGizmo && cameraConfig.useLookAhead)
{
    Vector3 cameraWorldPos = transform.position - cameraConfig.offset;
    Vector3 lookAheadTarget = cameraWorldPos + currentLookAhead;
    
    // Draw look-ahead vector
    if (currentLookAhead.magnitude > 0.1f)
    {
        Gizmos.color = Color.magenta;
        Gizmos.DrawLine(cameraWorldPos, lookAheadTarget);
        Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(lookAheadTarget, 0.2f);
    }
    
    // Draw velocity vector (scaled for visibility)
    if (playerVelocity.magnitude > cameraConfig.velocityThreshold)
    {
        Vector3 velocityEnd = player.position + playerVelocity * 0.5f;
        Gizmos.color = Color.yellow;
        Gizmos.DrawLine(player.position, velocityEnd);
        Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(velocityEnd, 0.1f);
    }
}
```

## üîß Public API Enhancement

### New Look-Ahead Methods
```csharp
// Velocity Information
public Vector3 GetPlayerVelocity()           // Current player velocity vector

// Look-Ahead State
public Vector3 GetCurrentLookAhead()         // Current look-ahead offset
public bool IsLookAheadActive()              // Check if look-ahead is currently applied

// Configuration
public void SetConfiguration(CameraConfigSO) // Resets look-ahead state on config change
public void SetPlayer(Transform)             // Resets tracking when player changes
public void SnapToTarget()                   // Resets look-ahead on instant positioning
```

### Runtime Configuration Examples
```csharp
// Enable look-ahead for exploration
cameraConfig.useLookAhead = true;
cameraConfig.lookAheadDistance = 1.5f;
cameraConfig.lookAheadSpeed = 3f;
cameraConfig.velocityThreshold = 0.3f;

// Disable look-ahead for precise platforming
cameraConfig.useLookAhead = false;

// High-speed chase configuration
cameraConfig.useLookAhead = true;
cameraConfig.lookAheadDistance = 3.5f;
cameraConfig.lookAheadSpeed = 8f;
cameraConfig.velocityThreshold = 1.0f;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Look-Ahead Processing Order
1. **Velocity Calculation**: Track player position changes
2. **Threshold Check**: Only activate if movement exceeds minimum speed
3. **Direction Normalization**: Create clean movement direction vector
4. **Axis Constraint Application**: Respect camera following limitations
5. **Distance Application**: Scale direction by configured look-ahead distance
6. **Smooth Transition**: Lerp to target look-ahead over time
7. **Bounds Integration**: Final camera position respects level boundaries

### Performance Optimization
- **Minimal Calculations**: Simple Vector3 operations per frame
- **Conditional Processing**: Early returns when look-ahead disabled
- **No Allocations**: All vector operations use existing references
- **Efficient Gizmos**: Debug visuals only drawn when enabled

### Integration Points
- **LateUpdate Integration**: Look-ahead calculated before camera positioning
- **Configuration System**: All settings stored in ScriptableObject
- **Event Compatibility**: Works with existing camera event systems
- **Bounds Post-Processing**: Look-ahead applied before bounds clamping

## üß† Design Decisions Explained

### Why Velocity-Based Detection?
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Actual player movement provides best direction prediction
- **Responsive Feel**: Camera anticipates where player is going, not where they've been
- **Natural Behavior**: Works intuitively with all movement types (walk, dash, jump)

### Why Smooth Transitions?
- **Player Comfort**: Prevents jarring camera movements during direction changes
- **Professional Feel**: Smooth camera behavior feels polished and intentional
- **Configurable Response**: Different games/situations need different transition speeds

### Parameter Range Choices
- **Distance (0-5)**: Practical range for 2D platformer camera anticipation
- **Speed (1-10)**: Covers slow cinematic to near-instant response
- **Threshold (0.1-2)**: From micro-movements to deliberate actions only

### Why Respect Axis Constraints?
- **Consistency**: Look-ahead follows same rules as regular camera following
- **Design Intent**: If Y-following is disabled, look-ahead shouldn't override that
- **Flexible Usage**: Allows side-scrolling games to only use horizontal look-ahead

## üéØ Recommended Settings for Mech Salvager

Based on tactical platformer gameplay requirements:

### **Standard Gameplay**
```csharp
useLookAhead = true;
lookAheadDistance = 1.8f;      // Moderate anticipation
lookAheadSpeed = 4f;           // Responsive but smooth
velocityThreshold = 0.4f;      // Ignore minor adjustments
```

### **Combat Encounters**
```csharp
useLookAhead = true;
lookAheadDistance = 2.5f;      // More anticipation for fast action
lookAheadSpeed = 6f;           // Quicker response for combat
velocityThreshold = 0.6f;      // Only during intentional movement
```

### **Precise Platforming**
```csharp
useLookAhead = false;          // Disable for maximum precision
// OR minimal settings:
lookAheadDistance = 0.8f;      // Very subtle
lookAheadSpeed = 2f;           // Slow transitions
velocityThreshold = 0.8f;      // Only during clear movement
```

### **High-Speed Sections**
```csharp
useLookAhead = true;
lookAheadDistance = 3.2f;      // Strong anticipation
lookAheadSpeed = 8f;           // Quick response
velocityThreshold = 1.2f;      // Only during fast movement
```
