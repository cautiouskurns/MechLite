# Task T1.1.2: Player GameObject Setup - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETED

### üéØ Overview
This guide documents the Player GameObject setup for Mech Salvager's 2D physics-based movement system. The player GameObject is now fully configured with all necessary components for movement, collision, and control.

### üì¶ Created Assets
- ‚úÖ **Player GameObject** in scene hierarchy at (0,0,0)
- ‚úÖ **PlayerController.cs** script (`Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs`)
- ‚úÖ **Ground GameObject** for testing physics
- ‚úÖ **Sprites folder** for future sprite assets

---

## üéÆ Player GameObject Configuration

### Transform Component
- **Position**: (0, 0, 0)
- **Rotation**: (0, 0, 0)
- **Scale**: (1, 1, 1)

### SpriteRenderer Component
- **Color**: Blue tint (RGB: 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, Alpha: 1.0)
- **Sorting Order**: 1 (renders above ground)
- **Sprite**: Unity's default white square (will be replaced with mech sprite later)

### Rigidbody2D Component ‚≠ê
- **Mass**: 1
- **Linear Drag**: 0.5
- **Angular Drag**: 0.05
- **Gravity Scale**: 1
- **Freeze Rotation Z**: ‚úÖ TRUE (prevents unwanted rotation)

### BoxCollider2D Component
- **Size**: (0.9, 0.9) - Slightly smaller than sprite for better gameplay feel
- **Is Trigger**: FALSE
- **Material**: None (default)

### PlayerController Component
- **Move Speed**: 5
- **Jump Force**: 10
- **Dash Force**: 15
- **Ground Layer Mask**: 1 (Default layer)
- **Ground Check Distance**: 0.1
- **Enable Debug Logs**: FALSE (can be enabled for testing)

## üéÆ PlayerController Script Features

### Core Movement System
- **Horizontal Movement**: Uses `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")` from T1.1.1 setup
- **Jump Mechanics**: Space key with ground detection
- **Dash System**: Left Shift key with cooldown (1 second)
- **Physics-Based**: All movement applied via Rigidbody2D for realistic physics

### Ground Detection
- **Raycast System**: Shoots ray downward from bottom of collider
- **Visual Debug**: Red/green ray visualization when debug logs enabled
- **Layer Filtering**: Uses LayerMask for specific ground layer detection

### Input Integration
- **Direct Integration**: Uses input system from T1.1.1
- **Responsive Controls**: Input read in Update(), physics applied in FixedUpdate()
- **State Tracking**: Tracks grounded state, dash availability, cooldowns

### Safety Features
- **Component Validation**: Checks all required components in Start()
- **Error Logging**: Clear error messages for missing components
- **Debug Options**: Optional debug logging for development/testing

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Manual Validation Checklist
- [ ] **Player GameObject**: Exists in hierarchy at (0,0,0)
- [ ] **SpriteRenderer**: Shows blue colored square sprite
- [ ] **Rigidbody2D**: All settings match specifications exactly
- [ ] **BoxCollider2D**: Size is (0.9, 0.9)
- [ ] **PlayerController**: Script attached and visible in Inspector
- [ ] **Gravity Test**: Player falls when Play is pressed
- [ ] **Ground Collision**: Player stops falling when hitting ground
- [ ] **Movement Test**: A/D keys move player horizontally
- [ ] **Jump Test**: Space key makes player jump when grounded
- [ ] **Dash Test**: Left Shift applies dash force

### Expected Behavior
1. **On Play**: Player GameObject should fall due to gravity
2. **Movement**: A/D keys should move player left/right smoothly
3. **Jumping**: Space key should make player jump (only when grounded)
4. **Dashing**: Left Shift should apply horizontal dash force
5. **Ground Detection**: Player should stop falling when hitting ground platform

### Debug Features
To enable detailed logging, set `enableDebugLogs = true` in PlayerController:
- Frame-by-frame state logging every 60 frames
- Ground detection ray visualization
- Jump and dash execution confirmation
- Velocity and input state tracking

## üîß Component Dependencies

### Required Components (Automatically Validated)
- **Rigidbody2D**: For physics-based movement
- **BoxCollider2D**: For collision detection and ground checking
- **SpriteRenderer**: For visual representation

### Input Dependencies
- **Unity Input Manager**: Must have "Horizontal" axis configured (from T1.1.1)
- **KeyCode.Space**: For jump input
- **KeyCode.LeftShift**: For dash input

---

## üéØ Physics Settings Explained

### Rigidbody2D Configuration
- **Mass (1)**: Standard mass for responsive movement
- **Linear Drag (0.5)**: Mild air resistance for natural deceleration
- **Angular Drag (0.05)**: Minimal rotational resistance
- **Gravity Scale (1)**: Normal gravity fall speed
- **Freeze Rotation Z (TRUE)**: Prevents mech from rotating during movement

### Collision Configuration
- **BoxCollider2D (0.9x0.9)**: Slightly smaller than sprite for forgiving collisions
- **Ground Check Distance (0.1)**: Short raycast for precise ground detection

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Ready for Next Phase
This Player GameObject setup provides the foundation for:
1. **T1.1.3**: Enhanced movement mechanics (wall jumping, air control)
2. **Combat System**: Weapon attachment points and combat interactions
3. **Animation System**: Sprite animation integration
4. **Visual Polish**: Custom mech sprites and effects

### Integration Points
- **Input System**: Fully integrated with T1.1.1 input configuration
- **Physics System**: Ready for collision with enemies and environment
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design supports additional components
- **Script Foundation**: PlayerController can be extended with new mechanics

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Player not falling**: Check Rigidbody2D has Gravity Scale = 1
- **No movement**: Verify Input Manager "Horizontal" axis is configured
- **Clipping through ground**: Ensure Ground GameObject has BoxCollider2D
- **No jumping**: Check Ground LayerMask matches Ground GameObject layer

### Performance Notes
- Ground detection uses single raycast (efficient)
- Physics applied in FixedUpdate for consistency
- Debug logging can be disabled for performance
- Modular component design allows easy optimization

*This setup establishes the core GameObject foundation that will be controlled by the input system and serve as the base for all future mech mechanics and systems.*
